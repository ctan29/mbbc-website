    <h1 className="decorative-title">Greetings</h1>
    <p>
      Due to queries about what we stand for biblically and the prevalence of
      apostasy in Christianity today, we wish to set forth this article of
      declaration of Biblical doctrines that we believe as members of the
      Metropolitan Bible Baptist Church and to which its membership must
      subscribe in its entirety.
    </p>

    <p>Article 1 &ndash; The Scriptures</p>

    <p>
      We believe the Holy Bible was written by men supernaturally inspired. It
      is truth without error for its substance. Therefore, it shall remain to
      the end of the age the only complete and final revelation of the will of
      God to man; the true center of Christian union and the supreme standard by
      which all human conduct, creeds, and opinions should be tried.
    </p>

    <p>
      By &ldquo;The Holy Bible&rdquo; we mean the collection of sixty-six books,
      from Genesis to Revelation, which, as it is written in the King James
      Version, does not only contain and convey the Word of God, but IS the very
      Word of God. By &ldquo;inspiration&rdquo; we mean the books of the Bible
      were written by holy men of old, as they were moved by the Holy Spirit, in
      such a definite way their writings were supernaturally and verbally
      inspired and free from error, as no other writings have ever been or ever
      will be inspired. The King James Version will be the exclusive text for
      all preaching, teaching and use in the Metropolitan Bible Baptist Church.
      (Psalm 19:7-11; 119:89, 105, 130, 160; Proverbs 30.5-6; Isaiah 8:20; Luke
      16:31; 24:25-27,44-45; John 5:39, 45-47; 12:48; 17:17; Acts 1:16; 28:25;
      Romans 3:4; 15:4; Ephesians 6:17; 2 Timothy 3:1 6-17; 1 Peter 1:23; 2
      Peter 1:19-21; Revelation 22:19)
    </p>

    <p>Article 2 &ndash; The True God</p>

    <p>
      We believe there is one, and only one, living and true God &ndash; an
      infinite, intelligent Spirit, the maker and supreme ruler of heaven and
      earth, inexpressibly glorious in holiness and worthy of all possible
      honour, confidence and love. In the unity of the Godhead there are three
      persons &ndash; the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost &ndash; equal in
      every divine perfection, and executing distinct but harmonious offices in
      the great work of redemption. (Genesis 17:1; Exodus 20:2-3; 15:11; Psalm
      83:18; 90:2; 147:5; Jeremiah 10:10; Matthew 28:19; Mark 12:30; John 4:24;
      10:30; 15:26; 17:5; Acts 5:3-4; Romans 11:23; 1 Corinthians 12:10-11; 8:6;
      12:4-6; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Ephesians 2:18; 4:6; Philippines 2:5-6; 1
      Timothy 1:17; 1 John 5:7; Revelation 4:11)
    </p>

    <p>Article 4 &ndash; The Holy Spirit</p>

    <p>
      We believe the Holy Spirit is a divine person equal with God the Father
      and God the Son and is of the same nature. He was active in the creation.
      In His relation to the unbelieving world, He restrains the evil one until
      God&rsquo;s purpose is fulfilled. He convicts of sin, of judgment and of
      righteousness&rsquo;, He bears witness to the Truth of the Gospel in
      preaching and testimony&rsquo;, He is the agent in the New Birth&rsquo;,
      He seals, endues, guides, teaches, witnesses, sanctifies and helps the
      believer. (Genesis 1 :13; Matthew 3:11; 28:19; Mark 1:8; Luke 1 :35; 3:1
      6; 24:49; John 1:33; 3:5-6; 14:16-17, 26; 15:26-27; 16:8-11, 13; Acts
      5:30-32; 11:16; Romans 8:14,16, 26-27; Ephesians 1:13-14; 2 Thessalonians
      2:7, 13; Hebrews 9:14; 1 Peter 1::2)
    </p>

    <p>Article 5 &ndash; The Devil, or Satan</p>

    <p>
      We believe Satan was once holy and enjoyed heavenly honours, but, through
      pride and ambition to be as the Almighty, fell and drew after him a host
      of angels. He is now the malignant prince of the power of the air and the
      unholy god of this world. We hold him to be man&rsquo;s great tempter, the
      enemy of God and Jesus Christ the accuser of the saints, the author of all
      false religions, the chief power behind the present apostasy, the lord of
      the antichrist, and the author of all the powers of darkness. He is
      destined, however, to final defeat at the hands of God&rsquo;s own Son and
      to the judgment of an eternal justice in the Lake of Fire &ndash; a place
      prepared for him and his angels. (lsaiah 14:12-15; Ezekiel 28:14-17;
      Matthew 4:1-3; 13:25; 25:41; 27:39; Mark 13:21-22; Luke 22:34; John 14:30;
      Ephesians 2:2; 2 Corinthians 11:13-15; 1 Thessalonians 3:5; 2
      Thessalonians 2:8-11 ; 1 Peter 5:8; 2 Peter 2:4; 1 John 2:22; 3:8; 4:3; 2
      John 7; Jude 6; Revelation 12:7-10; 13:13-14; 19:11; 16, 20; 20:1-3, 10)
    </p>

    <p>Article 6 &ndash; The Creation</p>

    <p>
      We believe in the Genesis account of creation. It is to be accepted
      literally, and not allegorically or figuratively. Man was created directly
      in God&rsquo;s own image and after His own likeness. Man&rsquo;s creation
      was not a matter of evolution or evolutionary change of species or
      development through interminable periods of time from lower to higher
      forms. AII animal and vegetable life was made directly, and God&rsquo;s
      established law was that they should bring forth only &ldquo;after their
      kind.&rdquo; (Genesis 1:1, 11, 24, 26-27; 2:21-23; Exodus 20:11; Nehemiah
      9:6; Jeremiah 10:12; John 1:3; Acts 4:24; 17:23-26; Romans 1:20;
      Colossians 1:16-17; Hebrews 11:3; Revelation 10:6)
    </p>

    <p>Article 7 &ndash; The Fall of Man</p>

    <p>
      We believe man was created in innocence under the law of his Maker, but by
      voluntary transgression fell from his sinless and happy state, in
      consequence of which all mankind are now sinners, and therefore under just
      condemnation without defense or excuse. Genesis 3:1-6, 24; Ezekiel
      18:19-20; Romans 1:18, 20, 28, 32; 3:10-19; 5:12, 19; Galatians 3:22;
      Ephesians 2:1, 3
    </p>

    <p>Article 8 &ndash; The Virgin Birth</p>

    <p>
      We believe Jesus Christ was begotten of the Holy Ghost in a miraculous
      manner &ndash; born of Mary, a virgin, as no other man was ever born or
      can ever be born of a woman; and He is both &ndash; the Son of God and God
      the Son. (Genesis 3:15; Psalm 2:7; Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:18-20; Mark 1:1;
      Luke 1:35; John 1:14; Galatians 4:4; 1 Corinthians 15:47; 1 John 5:20)
    </p>

    <p>Article 9 &ndash; The Atonement for Sin</p>

    <p>
      We believe the salvation of sinners is wholly of grace through the
      mediatorial office of the Son of God, Who by appointment of the Father,
      freely took upon Himself our nature, yet without sin. He honoured the
      divine law by His personal obedience, and by the shedding of His blood
      made a full and vicarious atonement for our sins &ndash; the voluntary
      substitution of Himself in the sinner&rsquo;s place, the Just dying for
      the unjust, Christ the Lord bearing our sins in His own body on the tree.
      Having risen from the dead, He is now enthroned in heaven and is in every
      way qualified to be a suitable, a compassionate and an all-sufficient
      Saviour. (Isaiah 53:4-7,11-12; Matthew 18:11; John 3:16; 10:18; Acts
      15:11; Romans 3:24-25; Galatians 1:4; Ephesians 2:8; Philippians 2:7-8;
      Hebrews 2:14; 7:25; 9:12-15; 12:2)
    </p>

    <p>Article 10 &ndash; The Grace in the New Creation</p>

    <p>
      We believe in order to be saved, sinners must be born again. The new birth
      is a new creation in Christ Jesus. It is instantaneous and not a process.
      In the new birth the one dead in trespasses and in sins is made a partaker
      of the divine nature and receives eternal life, the free gift of God. The
      new creation is brought about in a manner above our comprehension &ndash;
      not by culture, not by character, nor by the will of man, but wholly and
      solely by the power of the Holy Spirit in connection with divine truth, so
      as to secure our voluntary obedience to the gospel. Its proper evidence
      appears in the holy fruits of repentance and faith and newness of life.
      (Luke 5:27; John 1 :12-13; 3:3, 6-7; Acts 2:41; Romans 6:23; 2 Corinthians
      5:17, 19; Galatians 5:22; Ephesians 2:1; 5:9; Colossians 2:13; 1 John 5:1)
    </p>

    <p>Article 11 &ndash; The Freeness of Salvation</p>

    <p>
      We believe in God&rsquo;s saving grace. The blessings of salvation are
      made free to all by the gospel. It is the immediate duty of all to accept
      them (these blessings of salvation) by a penitent and obedient faith.
      Nothing prevents the salvation of the greatest sinner on earth but his own
      inherent depravity and voluntary rejection of the gospel which involves
      him in an aggravated condemnation. (Isaiah 55:1; Matthew 11:28; John
      3:15-18, 36; 5:40; 6:37; Acts 2:38; Romans 8:29-30; 10:13; 1 Corinthians
      15:10; Ephesians 2:4-5; Colossians 3:12; 1 Thessalonians 1:4; 1 Timothy
      1:15; Titus 1:1; 1 Peter 1:2; Revelation 22:17)
    </p>

    <p>Article 12 &ndash; Justification</p>

    <p>
      We believe the great gospel blessing which Christ secures to such as
      believe in Him is Justification. Justification includes the pardon of sin
      and the gift of eternal life through the righteousness of Jesus Christ. It
      is bestowed not in consideration of any works of righteousness which we
      have done, but solely through faith in the Redeemer&rsquo;s blood, His
      righteousness being imputed unto us. (Isaiah 53:11; Habakkuk 2:4;
      Zechariah 13:1; Acts 13:39; Romans 1:17; 4:1; 5:1-9; 8:1; Galatians 3:11;
      Titus 3:5-7; Hebrews 10:38)
    </p>

    <p>Article 13 &ndash; Repentance and Faith</p>

    <p>
      We believe Repentance and Faith are solemn obligations and inseparable
      graces and are wrought in our souls by the quickening Spirit of God. Being
      deeply convicted of our guilt, danger and helplessness, and that the way
      of salvation is by Christ, we turn to God with unfeigned contrition,
      confession and supplication for mercy, at the same time heartily receiving
      the Lord Jesus Christ and openly confessing Him as our only and
      all-sufficient Saviour. (Psalm 51:1-4,7; Isaiah 55:6-7; Mark 1:15; Luke
      12:8; 18:13; Acts 2:37-38; 20:21; Romans 10:9-11, 13)
    </p>

    <p>Article 14 &ndash; The Church</p>

    <p>
      We believe a local, New Testament Baptist Church is a congregation of
      baptized believers associated by a covenant of faith and fellowship of the
      gospel and is established by scriptural methods. Said church is understood
      to be the citadel and propagator of the Divine and Eternal Grace,
      observing the ordinances of Christ, governed by His laws, and exercising
      the gifts, rights, and privileges invested in them by His Word. Its
      officers of ordination are Pastors and Elders whose qualifications,
      claims, and duties are clearly defined in the Scriptures. We also accept
      the office of Deacon as established by Scripture, the office to be
      developed and used according to the need of the Church.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe that the local, New Testament Baptist Church, was founded by
      the Lord Jesus Christ during His ministry. The Church did not originate
      but was empowered by the Holy Ghost at Pentecost.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe the true mission of the local church is found in the Great
      Commission: 1) to make individual disciples 2) to build up the local
      church 3) to teach and instruct as He has commanded. It is the local, New
      Testament Baptist Church that is in charge of the education of its
      members. We do not believe in the reversal of this order.
    </p>

    <p>
      We hold that the local church has the absolute right of self-government,
      free from the interference of any hierarchy of individuals or
      organizations. The one and only superintendent is Christ through the Holy
      Spirit. It is scriptural for true churches to cooperate with each other in
      contending for the faith and for the furtherance of the Gospel. However,
      every local church is the sole and only judge of the measure and method of
      its co-operation on all matters of membership, of policy, of government,
      of discipline, of benevolence, the will of the local church being final.
      (Leviticus 27:31; Malachi 3:10; Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 2:41 -42; 6:5-6;
      14:23; 15:22-23; 20:17 -28; 1 Corinthians 5:11-13; 6:1-3; 11:2; 12:4,
      8-11; 16:1-2; Ephesians 1:22-23; 4:11; 5:23-24; Colossians 1:18; 1 Timothy
      3:1-13; Matthew 16:18; Luke 6:12-16; 7:18-20; Acts 1:4-15)
    </p>

    <p>Article 15 &ndash; Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper</p>

    <p>
      We believe scriptural baptism is to be administered under the authority of
      a local, New Testament Baptist church and is the immersion in water of a
      believer, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
      Ghost, showing forth in a solemn and beautiful symbol our faith in the
      crucified, buried and risen Saviour, with its effect in our death to sin
      and resurrection to a new life. Baptism is a prerequisite to the
      privileges of a local church relationship and to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.
      The Lord&rsquo;s Supper is observed by the sacred use of unleavened bread
      and the fruit of the vine (pure grape juice). We are to commemorate
      together the dying love of Christ preceded always by solemn
      self-examination. (Matthew 3:6; 3:16; 28:19-20; John 3:23; Acts 2:41-42;
      8:36-39; Romans 6:3-5; 1 Corinthians 11:23-28; Colossians 2:12)
    </p>

    <p>Article 16 &ndash; The Perseverance of the Saints</p>

    <p>
      We believe true believers will endure unto the end. Their persevering
      attachment to Christ is the grand mark which distinguishes them from
      superficial professors. A special providence watches over their welfare,
      and they are kept by the power of God through faith unto eternal
      salvation. (Psalm 121:3; Matthew 6:20; 13:19-21; John 8:31-32; 10:28-29;
      16:8; Romans 8:28, 35-39; Philippians 1:6; Colossians 1:21-23; Hebrews
      1:14; 1 Peter 1:5; 1 John 2:19)
    </p>

    <p>Article 17 &ndash; The Righteous and the Wicked</p>

    <p>
      We believe there is a radical and essential difference between the
      righteous and the wicked. Only those, justified through faith in the name
      of the Lord Jesus and sanctified by the Spirit of our God, are truly
      righteous in His esteem; while all such as continue in impenitence and
      unbelief are in His sight wicked and under the curse both in and after
      death, in the everlasting felicity of the saved and the everlasting
      conscious suffering of the lost. (Genesis 18:23; Proverbs 11:31; 14:32;
      Malachi 3:18; Matthew 7:13-14; 25:34; Luke 9:26; 16:25; John 8:21; 12:25;
      Acts 10:34-35; Romans 1:17; 6:16-18, 23; 7:6; 1 Corinthians 15:22;
      Galatians 3:10; 1 Peter 4:18; 1 John 2:7, 29; 5:19)
    </p>

    <p>Article 18 &ndash; Civil Government</p>

    <p>
      We believe civil government is of divine appointment, for the interests
      and good order of human society. Magistrates are to be prayed for and
      conscientiously honoured and obeyed (except only in things opposed to the
      will of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the only Lord of the conscience and
      the coming Prince of the kings of the earth). (Exodus 18:21-22; 2 Samuel
      23:3; Psalm 72:11; Daniel 3:17-18; Matthew 10:28; 22:21; 23:10; Acts
      4:19-20; 23:5; Romans 13:7; Philippians 2:10-11; Titus 3:1; 1 Peter
      2:13-14, 17)
    </p>

    <p>
      Article 19 &ndash; The Resurrection and Return of Christ and Related
      Events
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe in and accept the sacred Scriptures in their face and full
      value. Of the Resurrection, we believe Christ rose bodily
      &ldquo;&rsquo;the third day according to the Scriptures&rdquo;. He
      ascended &ldquo;to the right hand of the throne of God.&rdquo; He alone is
      our &ldquo;merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to
      God&rdquo; and &rdquo;that this same Jesus which is taken up from you into
      heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into
      heaven&rdquo; &ndash; bodily, personally, and visibly; the &ldquo;dead in
      Christ shall rise first&rdquo;; the living saints &ldquo;shall all be
      changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump&rdquo;
      and &ldquo;that the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father
      David&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Christ shall reign a thousand years in
      righteousness until He hath put all enemies under His feet.&rdquo; (Psalm
      72:8; Isaiah 11:4-5; Matthew 24:27, 42; Matthew 28:6-7; Mark 16:6, 19;
      Luke 1:32; Luke 24:2, 4-6, 39, 51; John 14:3; John 20:27; Acts 1:9, 11; 1
      Corinthians 15:4; Philippians 4:20; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; 1 Timothy 2:5;
      Hebrews 2:17; 5:9; 8:1; 9:28; 12:2)
    </p>

    <p>Article 20 &ndash; Missions</p>

    <p>
      The command to give the gospel to the world is clear and unmistakable, and
      this Commission was given to the local church.
    </p>

    <p>
      Matthew 28:18-20; &ldquo;And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying All
      power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach
      all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
      of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
      commanded you and, lo I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
      Amen.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      Mark 16:15, &ldquo;And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world and
      preach the gospel to every creature.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      John 20:21, &ldquo;As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      Acts 1:8, &ldquo;But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is
      come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in
      all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the
      earth.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      Romans 10:13-15, &ldquo;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord
      shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not
      believed? And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
      And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach,
      except they be sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them
      that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good
      things!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>Article 21 &ndash; The Grace of Giving</p>

    <p>Scriptural giving is one of the fundamentals of the Faith.</p>

    <p>
      2 Corinthians 8:7 &ldquo;Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith,
      and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to
      us, see that ye abound in this grace also.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      We are commanded to bring our gifts into the storehouse (common treasury
      of the local church) upon the first day of the week.
    </p>

    <p>
      1 Corinthians 16:2, &ldquo;Upon the first day of the week let every one of
      you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no
      gatherings when I come.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      Under Grace we give (and do not pay) the tithe &ndash; &ldquo;Abraham gave
      the tenth of the spoils,&rdquo; &ndash; Hebrews 7:2, 4. This was four
      hundred years before the law and is confirmed in the New Testament. Jesus
      said concerning the tithe, &ldquo;these ought ye to have done, Matthew
      23:23.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are commanded to bring the tithe into the common treasury of the local
      church. Leviticus 27:30, &rdquo;The tithe &#8230; is the
      Lord&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Malachi 3:10, &ldquo;Bring ye all the tithes into the
      storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house) and prove me now
      herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of
      heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough
      to receive it.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      In the New Testament, it was the common treasury of the local church. Acts
      4:34, 35, 37, &ldquo;And brought the prices of the things that were sold
      and laid them down at the apostles&rsquo; feet &#8230; Having land, sold
      it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles&rsquo; feet.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>Article 22 &ndash; Human Sexuality</p>

    <p>
      We believe that God has commanded that no intimate sexual activity should
      be engaged in outside of a marriage between a man and a woman. We believe
      that any form of homosexuality, lesbianism, bisexuality, bestiality,
      incest, fornication, adultery, and pornography are sinful perversions of
      God&rsquo;s original intent for the proper, Biblical sexual relationship.
      (Genesis 2:24, 19:5, 13, 26:8-9; Leviticus 18:1-30; Romans 1:26-29; 1
      Corinthians 5:1, 6:9; 1 Thessalonians 4:1-8; Hebrews 13:4)
    </p>

    <p>Article 23 &ndash; Life</p>

    <p>A. Abortion</p>

    <p>
      1. We believe that human life begins at conception, and that the unborn
      child is a living human being. Abortion constitutes the unjustified,
      unexcused killing of unborn, human life. As such, abortion is murder. (Job
      3:16; Psalm 51:5, 139:14-16; Isaiah 44:24 and Isaiah 49:1-5; Jeremiah 1:5,
      20:15-18; Luke 1:44)
    </p>

    <p>
      2. We reject any teaching that abortions of pregnancies due to rape,
      incest, birth defects, gender selection, birth or population control, or
      the physical or mental well being of the mother are acceptable. (Proverbs
      6:21)
    </p>

    <p>B. Euthanasia</p>

    <p>
      1. We believe that the direct taking of an innocent human life is a sin,
      regardless of the intention. Life is a gift of God, and must be respected
      from conception until natural death. (Genesis 1:31, Genesis 2:1-25; Psalm
      139:14-16; Acts 17:28)
    </p>

    <p>
      2. Thus, we believe that an act or omission which, of itself or by
      intention, causes death in order to eliminated suffering constitutes a
      murder contrary to the will of God. (Exodus 20:13; 23:7; Matthew 5:21)
    </p>

    <p>C. Capital Punishment</p>

    <p>
      1. We believe that God grants to human government the right to execute
      criminals, and that He commands that certain crimes to be punished by
      death. (Genesis 9:6; Romans 13:1-4)
    </p>

    <p>
      2. We believe that the primary reason for capital punishment is to punish
      the offender. (Genesis 9:6; Romans 13:1-4)
    </p>

    <p>Article 24 &ndash; Separation</p>

    <p>
      A. We believe that God has called the saved to holy life separate from sin
      (1 Thessalonians 4:7) and from communion with this world in at least three
      areas: Personal Separation, Separation in Questionable Things, and
      Ecclesiastical Separation.
    </p>

    <p>1. Personal Separation</p>

    <p>
      a. We believe that at least three tests of true love for God are given in
      Scripture:
    </p>

    <p>
      1) Willingness to obey Christ&rsquo;s commands (John 14:15, 21, 23,
      15:10-14)
    </p>

    <p>
      2) Willingness to separate from all known sin (1 Thessalonians 4:7- 8; 1
      John 5:2-3 compare 1 John 3:4-10; 1 Peter 1:14-16)
    </p>

    <p>3) Hatred for the satanic world system (1 John 2:15-16; James 4:4)</p>

    <p>b. We believe that this separation is to be:</p>

    <p>
      1) Passive&ndash;not participating in, supporting, or taking vicarious
      pleasure in things which God hates and opposes. (1 Peter 2:11; Romans
      1:32; 1 Thessalonians 4:3-6; James 1:27)
    </p>

    <p>
      2) Active&ndash;exposing, warning, and resisting evil by our life and
      influence (Ephesians 5:11; 1 Timothy 4:11, 6:2b; 2 Timothy 4:2; Titus
      1:11-13; Romans 12:21)
    </p>

    <p>
      3) Positive&ndash;thinking on, listening to, watching, doing, and using
      only things that are true, honourable, just, pure, lovely, of good report,
      virtuous, and praiseworthy. (Philippians 4:8; 1 Peter 2:12-15)
    </p>

    <p>
      4) Negative&ndash;putting off evil so that we can put on good. (Ephesians
      4:22-27)
    </p>

    <p>
      c. We believe that personal separation involves at least the following
      areas:
    </p>

    <p>1) Our speech. (Ephesians 4:31, 5:3; Colossians 4:6)</p>

    <p>2) Our behavior. (1 Peter 2:12)</p>

    <p>3) Our moral principles. (1 Thessalonians 4:6-7; Exodus 20:1-17)</p>

    <p>
      4) Our appearance, dress, and hair length. (1 Thessalonians 5:22;
      Deuteronomy 22:5; 1 Corinthians 11:14-15; 1 Timothy 2:9-10; 1 Peter 3:1-6)
    </p>

    <p>5) Our choice of friends. (Proverbs 13:20)</p>

    <p>6) Our choice of counselors. (Psalm 1:1)</p>

    <p>7) Our occupation. (1 Thessalonians 4:11-12)</p>

    <p>
      8) Our choice of things we read, see, do, and the music we listen to.
      (Philippians 4:8)
    </p>

    <p>2. Separation in Questionable Things</p>

    <p>a. We believe in the individual priesthood of the believer.</p>

    <p>
      1) This means that God has given to every person the privilege of direct
      access to God. (1 Timothy 2:5; Hebrews 4:16; 1 Peter 2:9; Revelation 1:6)
    </p>

    <p>
      2) This means also that every person has the right to interpret the
      Scriptures for himself in order to discover its facts and truths and to
      establish his own beliefs, convictions, and practices from this study. (2
      Timothy 2:15; Acts 17:11; Galatians 5:1)
    </p>

    <p>
      3) This does not mean that an individual has the liberty to twist, doubt,
      or disobey the original intent of the Scripture as God has revealed it in
      the Bible. We also believe that a local church and/or another believer has
      the liberty to disagree with and if necessary not accept into fellowship
      those deviating from sound doctrine and practice. (2 Peter 3:16; Matthew
      5:17-20; 1 Corinthians 5:1-13)
    </p>

    <p>
      4) This does not mean that our liberty in Christ extends to the point of:
    </p>

    <p>(a) sin (Ephesians 5:11-12; 1 Thessalonians 5:8)</p>

    <p>(b) carnal behavior (Galatians 5:13-15; 1 Peter 2:16)</p>

    <p>
      (c) behavior that may tempt or weaken the faith of others (see
      &ldquo;d.&rdquo; below)
    </p>

    <p>
      b. We believe that it is not God&rsquo;s will for believers to judge one
      another with respect to things indifferent to God. (By &ldquo;things
      indifferent&rdquo; we mean things about which God has given no clear
      statement or principle in His Word, or things that He has said in His Word
      that make no difference to Him.) (Deuteronomy 29:29) In things indifferent
      the following principles apply:
    </p>

    <p>
      1) The strong should receive the weak and not argue with them about their
      opinions. (Romans 14:1-3)
    </p>

    <p>
      2) The weak should not judge the strong because things indifferent have
      nothing to do with our standing before God. (Romans 14:3b-12)
    </p>

    <p>
      3) God deals with each according to his own conscience in things
      indifferent and God has called all believers to peace in such matters.
      (Romans 14:5b, 19, 22-23)
    </p>

    <p>
      c. We believe that as believers we are called by God to limit our liberty
      in Christ in matters that we may not consider to be sin but could tempt
      others to sin or that would be considered to be sin. (1 Peter 2:16; Romans
      14:13; 1 Corinthians 8:9, 13; 1 Thessalonians 5:22). Several principles to
      govern our conduct in this area would be as follows:
    </p>

    <p>1) Does it glorify the Lord? (1 Corinthians 6:20, 10:31)</p>

    <p>
      2) Could it be a stumbling block to other believers? (Romans 14:13, 20-21;
      1 Corinthians 8:9, 13)
    </p>

    <p>3) Will it harm my body? (1 Corinthians 6:19-20; Ephesians 4:30)</p>

    <p>
      4) Do I want to reap this later in my life and in the lives of my
      children? (Galatians 6:7-8)
    </p>

    <p>
      5) Will it build and strengthen my Christian life? (1 Corinthians 10:23,
      6:12)
    </p>

    <p>
      6) Does it make me look, act, or become more like the world? (1 John
      2:15-16; James 4:4)
    </p>

    <p>
      7) Do I have doubts about whether it is right or not? (Romans 14:22-23)
    </p>

    <p>
      8) Does it seem evil or questionable to others? (1 Thessalonians 5:22; 1
      Corinthians 10:23-33)
    </p>

    <p>3. Ecclesiastical Separation</p>

    <p>
      a. We believe that God desires love and unity among all true believers and
      that this unity be based upon the doctrinal truths of His word. (John
      13:34-35, 17:21-23 compare John 17:17; 1 Corinthians 13:6; Philippians
      1:9-10; Deuteronomy 13:3-4)
    </p>

    <p>b. We believe that God has commanded all believers to:</p>

    <p>
      1) Form no spiritual unions with or be found in cooperation among
      unbelievers. (2 Corinthians 6:14-17)
    </p>

    <p>
      2) &ldquo;Mark&rdquo; and &ldquo;avoid&rdquo; those who cause divisions or
      teach doctrinal error regardless of their &ldquo;good words and fair
      speeches&rdquo; (Romans 16:17-20)
    </p>

    <p>3) &ldquo;Withdraw&rdquo; from those who:</p>

    <p>
      (a) Do not consent to the words and teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ. (1
      Timothy 6:3; Titus 1:16-2:15)
    </p>

    <p>
      (b) Teach doctrine not promoting godliness. (1 Timothy 6:3; John 9:11)
    </p>

    <p>
      (c) Become argumentative over unimportant questions. (Titus 3:9-11; 1
      Timothy 6:4)
    </p>

    <p>
      (d) Believe that material gain is a sign of godliness and God&rsquo;s
      approval. (1 Timothy 6:5)
    </p>

    <p>
      4) &ldquo;Rebuke sharply&rdquo; those whose behavior does not conform with
      sound faith and doctrine appropriate for believers. (Titus 1:13-2:15; 1
      Timothy 6:1-2, 5)
    </p>

    <p>
      c. We also believe that it is unwise to work together with believers who
      do not hold to a firm stand of separation since compromise leads to
      apostasy and sin. (Exodus 34:12-14; Numbers 33:51-55; Deuteronomy 7:1-5;
      Judges 1:36, 2:1-23; Solomon, Asa, etc.)
    </p>

    <p>
      d. We therefore disavow the position both of those organizations and
      fellowships:
    </p>

    <p>
      1) Where unbelief and error has developed to the point where apostasy is
      recognizable and indisputable, and
    </p>

    <p>
      2) Where the position of separation does not conform with that stated
      above since any other position constitutes an unscriptural compromise
      which may lead to apostasy and sin. We believe it is right to pray for
      those true Christians who hold this error, but we believe it is wrong to
      work with or cooperate with them.
    </p>

    <p>
      e. We therefore disavow the position of the World Council of Churches, the
      National Council of Churches, the National Association of Evangelicals,
      and any other association, fellowship or missions agency that would be in
      sympathy with them.
    </p>

    <p>
      f. We stand in opposition to the Ecumenical Movement, Neo-Orthodoxy, New
      Evangelicalism, and cooperative evangelism programs between churches and
      people not of like precious faith and practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      g. We believe in divine healing (James 5:14-15), but we believe that the
      modern tongues, charismatic, and healing movement violates many direct
      Scriptural statements and must be rejected as being contrary to sound
      doctrine. (2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:15-21; 1 Corinthians 14:27-40
      especially I Corinthians 14:37; Deuteronomy 13:1-5, 18:20-22; Matthew
      7:21-23)
    </p>
  </>
